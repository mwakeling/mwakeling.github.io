    <h1>Trees</h1>
    <p>The trees we offer are balsam fir. The balsam fir has soft needles and a lovely Christmas tree aroma. We have 14,000 trees on 14 acres. Every May we plant seedlings. They grow and grow until mid-July when they are sheared to shape. The limbs harden shortly after and are ready for the season.  </p>
    <h1>Wreaths and Kissing Balls</h1>
    <p>Carla Purinton handcrafts every wreath and kissing ball with the help of family. All the items are hand-crafted in the basement of the Purinton family home.

If you would like a custom-made wreath or kissing ball, please call and ask for Carla.</p>
