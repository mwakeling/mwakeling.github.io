      <h1>FUN FACTS</h1>
      <p>This page is dedicated to fun or interesting things about myself. </p>
      <h1>HOBBIES</h1>
      <p>I have a lot of hobbies. Aside from copious amounts of video games, I also snowboard, mountain bike, and even skateboard on occasion. I also play a lot of music, particularly the drums and the guitar. My favorite genre is probably alternative rock.</p>
      <h1>PERORMING</h1>
      <p>I like to perform. Starting in middle school, I began doing the yearly musicals and dramas, and even landed a few lead roles in some of them. Along with this, I also play a very big role in Talent Night, an annual competition run by our school where each of the classes is tasked with creating a thirty minute skit written and directed by us. In these, I take a large role in not only performing, but writing it as well. Performing live music is also something I enjoy quite a lot. I have been in a few bands, and each of them have played out in some form, whether it be basement parties, or open mic nights.</p>
      <h1>OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES</h1>
      <p>Living in Vermont provides a lot of opportunities for getting out and getting active, all year around. In the summers, I do a lot of biking, whether that be on mountains, or just with my friends around town. Vermont has a lot of designated mountain biking trails, many of which are free to the public, which my dad and I have made copious use of. In addition to the local trails, me and my father go out to Eastern Vermont every year to go camping and ride the trails. In the winter, I do lot of snowboarding, mostly in Vermont, but sometimes I get to make it out to other states. </p>
