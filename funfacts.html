      <h1>FUN FACTS</h1>
      <p>This page is dedicated to fun or interesting things about myself.</p>
      <h1>HOBBIES</h1>
      <p>I have a lot of hobbies. Besides copious amounts of video games, I also snowboard, mountain bike, and even skateboard on occasion. I also play a lot of music, particularly the drums, guitar, and vocals. My favorite genre is alternative rock.
</p>
      <h1>PERORMING</h1>
      <p>I like to perform. Starting in middle school, I began doing the yearly musicals and dramas, and even landed a few lead roles in some of them. I also play a large role in Talent Night, an annual competition run by our school where each of the classes is tasked with creating a thirty-minute skit written and directed by the students. In these, I take a large role, not only performing but writing as well. Performing live music is also something I enjoy quite a lot. I have been in a few bands, and each of them has played live in some form, whether it be basement parties or open-mic nights.</p>
      <h1>OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES</h1>
      <p>Living in Vermont provides a lot of opportunities for getting out and being active all year round. In the summers, I do a lot of biking, in the mountains or just with my friends around town. Vermont has many designated mountain biking trails, many of which are free to the public, which my dad and I use often. In addition to the local trails, my father and I go out to North Eastern Vermont every year to go camping and ride the trails. I snowboard in the winter, mostly in Vermont, but sometimes I get to make it out to other states. </p>
